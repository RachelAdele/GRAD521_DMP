Data Management Plan for the research project Development and Effective Validation of Antifungal Edible Coating for Extending Post-Harvest Storability of Pineapples (Ananas comosus)

Context:
Edible coatings are commonly used in the food industry to make fruits and vegetables last longer, both for the benefit of the consumer and to reduce losses along the supply chain. Fruit may become inedible due to ripening or a variety of diseases/ disorders, and edible coatings seek to prevent or mitigate the effects of these issues. Mold on pineapples causes great losses along the supply chain, therefore this project seeks to develop a polymer-based edible coating formulation that will slow ripening by restricting the loss of water and access to oxygen which allow breakdown and drying out, with an incorporated antifungal agent to prevent mold growth. This will be done by comparing pineapples coated with various edible coating formulations and concentrations across a variety of analyses, as well as comparing the coating formulations themselves and films made from them.
