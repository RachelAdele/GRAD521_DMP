# Data description
Edible coatings are commonly used in the food industry to make fruits and vegetables last longer, both for the benefit of the consumer and to reduce losses along the supply chain. Fruit may become inedible due to ripening or a variety of diseases/ disorders, and edible coatings seek to prevent or mitigate the effects of these issues. Mold on pineapples causes great losses along the supply chain, therefore this project seeks to develop a polymer-based edible coating formulation that will slow ripening by restricting the loss of water and access to oxygen which allow breakdown and drying out, with an incorporated antifungal agent to prevent mold growth. This will be done by comparing pineapples coated with various edible coating formulations and concentrations across a variety of analyses, as well as comparing the coating formulations themselves and films made from them.

# Roles and responsibilities
Because of the nature of this research, almost all of the responsibilities with the data belong to myself, the primary researcher, especially with raw data. These obligations include collection, uploading and organization of the data for each preliminary and final trial with different pineapple coatings, as well as synthesis and analysis of the data. I will be personally and independently implementing the DMP. The only other individuals involved in the process are firstly possibly the lab post-doc, who may help with data collection and instrument maintenance, and of course my PI, who assists with data analysis, communication, publication and presentation, as well as setting metadata protocols for the lab.
