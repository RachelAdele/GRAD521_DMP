# Data description
This project will endeavor to answer the following questions: What formulation of edible coating best extends the post-harvest shelf life of pineapple fruits? What matrix components at what concentrations best form the necessary microenvironment around the fruit to slow physical and microbial degradation? To answer these questions, the physiological changes which indicate ripening of pineapples will be compared within and between treatments in an experimental design by collecting quantitative data of the weight loss, color change, firmness, titratable acidity (TA), and sugar content (TSS), as well as fungal and microbial growth. All of these variables will be measured or calculated as necessary according to the metadata protocol maintained by the lab. All values will be ultimately numerical, and maintained in an Excel spreadsheet format for the purposes of data entry and analysis. Data collection requires a variety of experimental methods, equipment and instrumentation, including but not limited to the following:
i.	A scale for weight loss measurements, with values uploaded into a spreadsheet.
ii.	Photos taken with an iPhone camera, uploaded and arranged into folders with organized naming schemes indicating the date and  
   treatment, as well as .txt files in each folder to explain the contents as necessary. 
iii.	Color change values calculated with Hunter LAB colorimeter data, entered into an excel spreadsheet, compared to the initial color.
iv.	Firmness assessed with a texture analyzer and Exponent Connect software, by plunging a stainless-steel cylinder into the pineapple 
    flesh and assessing the Newtons of force necessary.
v. TA and TSS and analyzed by blending sample in a Proctor Silex blender for one minute, then using a handheld refractometer to measure 
    TSS, and a pH meter to titrate with 0.1N NaOH and calculate to find % equivalent citric acid for TA.
vi.	Antifungal capacity tested by plating buffer water massaged on the pineapple surface onto Petri dishes and counting mold colonies 
    that grow after one week.
vii.	All parameters will be averaged across all pineapples analyzed and the standard deviation found and reported, with SAS software 
    used to assess statistically significant differences via ANOVA and post-hoc LSD.

All of the datasets together except photos will be kept in one excel spreadsheet, each on a different page, all of which should not exceed 1 MB total. Because of the short shelf life of pineapple fruits, the opportunities for photos are few, thus will not exceed 1 GB.


# Roles and responsibilities
Because of the nature of this research, almost all of the responsibilities with the data belong to myself, the primary researcher, especially with raw data. These obligations include collection, uploading and organization of the data for each preliminary and final trial with different pineapple coatings, as well as synthesis and analysis of the data. The PI will be implementing the DMP, as well as assistsing with data analysis, communication, publication and presentation, and setting metadata protocols for the lab. The lab post-doc may help with data collection and instrument maintenance. The funding for this project comes contractually through the company FiberLean, but they will not collect or receive any raw data.

# Data standards and metadata
There are no metadata standards specifically for the food science field, but internally our lab has many metadata practices detailed in written documents both for the collection and analysis of data, which will be followed for the duration of this project. Because of its broad scope of use, data documentation for this project will use the metadata standard CERIF as an extended-function database by entering numerical data and linking it with associated photographs under categories with additional metadata content. This would include (but is not limited to) abbreviation meanings, methods of data collection, and other information linked to the project and metadata as a whole, as well as the individual aspects of the data for which they are relevant. In addition, the lab will maintain data dictionaries to make existing spreadsheets more accessbile, as well as written manuals for setup and usage of equipment to collect data, both from manufacturers and written internally. Lastly, for the photographs associated with projects, these will be uploaded with text delineating details such as date, photographer and treatment condition of the fruit.

# Storage and security
The data for this project will be stored and updated in the following locations: My personal laptop (which will be backed up to an external hard drive monthly), a USB, and Google Drive, totaling four locations with each backup. The data will be retained and maintained personally throughout the duration of my time at OSU, and the files on Google Drive shared with the PI and post-doc for access, download and manipulation after I leave the program. This will allow the data to remain unchanged and unreliant on my location. By saving the data in multiple locations (physical and in the cloud), this ensures that instance such as damage, theft, or a glitch in the cloud cannot topple the project. Although it requires time and coordination to save all data in all three locations, it is necessary especially as the quantity of data collected grows to backup in this way. There is no shared network drive for the Food Science and Technology department on which to save the data, but ultimately this limits access to only those who are collecting data or in charge of the project (PI).

# Access and data sharing
The data for my project/s is collected as funded and instructed by the company FiberLean using our patented OSU technology and processes. Because of these parameters and the competitive nature of the industry, our data and reports are all confidential, meaning I will not be able to make the data publicly available. The data (in the form of spreadsheets and photos) is available to those who work to collect it (at OSU main campus and the Mid-Columbia Research and Extension Center), as well as individuals within FiberLean upon request, but otherwise must remain protected for funding and patented technology reasons. I do not expect that this data will ever be publicly available due to these restrictions as well as the nature of the work. Additionally, because the data is collected from one specific experimental process and funneled into a single publication, it would not be of great use for a repository or metanalysis.

# Archiving and preservation
Both photographic and numerical data are of high importance for these projects, and once the research concludes, due to the likelihood of future building upon it, all data will be archived for at least 15 years. This is done first with collaboration between the research/ data collection team to ensure an overall and holistic organized data structure within folders and subfolders. The next step is archiving via forwarding these folders to the PI, who maintains all project information from the lab on her personal drives, in the form of folders containing sub-folders of photos, spreadsheets, and .txt files with explanations of the data and metadata as necessary for use once the primary researcher/ data collector or compiler has left the institution. The photos will be saved in a compatible .jpg format and the spreadsheets converted from Excel to .csv files to ensure longevity and accessibility.
