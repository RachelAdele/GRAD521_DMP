# Data description
Edible coatings are commonly used in the food industry to make fruits and vegetables last longer, both for the benefit of the consumer and to reduce losses along the supply chain. Fruit may become inedible due to ripening or a variety of diseases/ disorders, and edible coatings seek to prevent or mitigate the effects of these issues. Mold on pineapples causes great losses along the supply chain, therefore this project seeks to develop a polymer-based edible coating formulation that will slow ripening by restricting the loss of water and access to oxygen which allow breakdown and drying out, with an incorporated antifungal agent to prevent mold growth. This will be done by comparing pineapples coated with various edible coating formulations and concentrations across a variety of analyses, as well as comparing the coating formulations themselves and films made from them.

# Roles and responsibilities
Because of the nature of this research, almost all of the responsibilities with the data belong to myself, the primary researcher, especially with raw data. These obligations include collection, uploading and organization of the data for each preliminary and final trial with different pineapple coatings, as well as synthesis and analysis of the data. The PI will be implementing the DMP, as well as assistsing with data analysis, communication, publication and presentation, and setting metadata protocols for the lab. The lab post-doc may help with data collection and instrument maintenance. The funding for this project comes contractually through the company FiberLean, but they will not collect or receive any raw data.

# Data standards and metadata
There are no metadata standards specifically for the food science field, but internally our lab has many metadata practices detailed in written documents both for the collection and analysis of data, which will be followed for the duration of this project. Because of its broad scope of use, data documentation for this project will use the metadata standard CERIF as an extended-function database by entering numerical data and linking it with associated photographs under categories with additional metadata content. This would include (but is not limited to) abbreviation meanings, methods of data collection, and other information linked to the project and metadata as a whole, as well as the individual aspects of the data for which they are relevant. In addition, the lab will maintain data dictionaries to make existing spreadsheets more accessbile, as well as written manuals for setup and usage of equipment to collect data, both from manufacturers and written internally. Lastly, for the photographs associated with projects, these will be uploaded with text delineating details such as date, photographer and treatment condition of the fruit.

# Storage and security
The data for this project will be stored and updated in the following locations: My personal laptop (which will be backed up to an external hard drive monthly), a USB, and Google Drive, totaling four locations with each backup. The data will be retained and maintained personally throughout the duration of my time at OSU, and the files on Google Drive shared with the PI and post-doc for access, download and manipulation after I leave the program. This will allow the data to remain unchanged and unreliant on my location. By saving the data in multiple locations (physical and in the cloud), this ensures that instance such as damage, theft, or a glitch in the cloud cannot topple the project. Although it requires time and coordination to save all data in all three locations, it is necessary especially as the quantity of data collected grows to backup in this way. There is no shared network drive for the Food Science and Technology department on which to save the data, but ultimately this limits access to only those who are collecting data or in charge of the project (PI).
